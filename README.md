# FM Manip Tool

A program to route RNG Manipulation in Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories.

## Getting Started

You can get the latest release at the [Github page](https://github.com/GenericMadScientist/FM-Manip-Tool/releases). Provided you're on Windows the .exe should run out-of-the-box. If you're on another OS then let me know and I'll see about making a build for you if you're unable to do so on your own. If this is an issue, or if you need help using this, then join the [FM Discord](https://discord.gg/ygofm) and feel free to ask questions.

An explanation of how to use this is given in TUTORIAL.txt.

## Libraries

I use Qt 5, which you can get from the [Qt website](https://info.qt.io/download-qt-for-application-development). I also use the SQLite3 C library, which you can get from the [SQLite website](https://www.sqlite.org).

## Licensing

My code is released under the MIT license. Qt is released under the GNU LGPL version 3. SQLite3 is public domain. The MIT license can be found in LICENSE.txt, while Qt's license can be found in QT_LICENSE.txt.
