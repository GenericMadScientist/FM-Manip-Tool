# FM Manip Tool

A program to route RNG Manipulation in Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories.

## Getting Started

You can get the latest release at the [Github page](https://github.com/GenericMadScientist/FM-Manip-Tool/releases). Provided you're on Windows the .exe should run out-of-the-box. If you're on another OS and are comfortable with the command line, see the [Building from Source](#building-from-source) section for instructions. If not, then let me know and I'll see about making a build for you if you're unable to do so on your own. If this is an issue, or if you need help using this, then join the [FM Discord](https://discord.gg/ygofm) and feel free to ask questions.

An explanation of how to use this is given in TUTORIAL.txt.

## Libraries

I use Qt 5, which you can get from the [Qt website](https://info.qt.io/download-qt-for-application-development). I also use the SQLite3 C library, which you can get from the [SQLite website](https://www.sqlite.org).

## Building from Source
This has been tested on Linux, but should work for MacOS as well.

### Prerequisites
1. `git`
2. `unzip`
3. `qt5` (includes `qmake`) -  On Ubuntu the package is named `qt5-default`, on Arch it is `qt5-base`. [More info](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/qt)
4. `make`
5. `sqlite3` - Download the zip from under the "Source Code" section on the [SQLite Download Page](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html). The file should be named something like `sqlite-amalgamation-3400100.zip` with differing numbers for a different version. The latest version listed there is fine.

### Steps
1. Clone this repository - `git clone https://github.com/GenericMadScientist/FM-Manip-Tool.git`
2. `cd ./FM-Manip-Tool/`
3. Extract required sqlite files from the zip downloaded (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)). Note the file name and path of the download may differ. - `unzip ~/Downloads/sqlite-amalgamation-3400100.zip '*/sqlite3.[ch]'`
4. Rename extracted directory to expected name - `mv ./sqlite-amalgamation-3400100/ ./lib/`
5. Make a build output directory - `mkdir ./build-release/`
6. `cd ./build-release/`
7. `QT_SELECT=5 qmake ../FM_Manip_Tool.pro` (prefixing with `QT_SELECT=5` to ensure qt5 is used instead of another installed version)
8. `QT_SELECT=5 make`
9. `cp ../data/* .`
10. Run the app and profit ðŸŽ‰ - `./FM\ Manip\ Tool`
11. (Bonus) Make the app runnable from anywhere:
```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
DIR="/<YOUR-PATH-TO>/FM-Manip-Tool/build-release/"
cd "$DIR" && "./FM Manip Tool"
```
You can name the script something like `fm-manip-tool`, place it somewhere in your `PATH`, call it from anywhere in the command line, make a `.desktop` shortcut out of it, etc.
